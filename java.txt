how can we check what certs are providing by java by default 


install java

location = /opt/jdk/jre/lib/security/cacerts


so we can check the certs by using 

keytool -keystore /opt/jdk/jre/lib/security/cacerts -v -list 

 
or 

keytool -list -keystore cacerts


if I want to add some certs to existing java trust store then we have to the certs using this command. 


get the .crt like which crt you want to add to cacrt

then run this command 

keytool -keystore cacerts -importcert -alias blt -file /opt/jdk/jre/lib/security/blt.crt 


this is importing cert into your certficate store. enter password "ch"

then count the certs again using the command 


keytool -list -keystore cacert


so this how we use to add companies certs to truststore
