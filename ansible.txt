ansible commands 


#install packages in remote server 

once we added remote hosts in ansible controlled server [/etc/ansible/hosts]
in this cases i added inventory hosts names as test1. test1 have only 1 server. 



Install git software on remote server using ansible. 


1). ansible test1 -b -m yum -a  "name=git state=installed"
  -b ==  become a root or sudoers (escalate permissions)
  -m ==  module or task perform
  -a ==  arguments to pass while installing the softwares. 

2) ansible test1 -b -m yum -a  "name=git state=absent"

 it will uninstall the software.
